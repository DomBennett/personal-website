"Living fossil" is a term coined by Darwin often used to describe organisms
that appear to be ancient and have changed little. The term, however, is hugely
controversial: it has multiple definitions and interpretations; it seems to
recall the debunked Victorian science of "evolutionary progress"; and many,
wrongly, use the term to argue that evolution can be halted.

In my PhD I attempted to take a new look at the term. I wanted to understand
whether the term could be a real label: does it denote a unique category of
biodiversity? I also attempted to clarify the concept by proposing a
quantifiable definition. Additionally, I explored what the label means for
conservation biologists (Are living fossils worth conserving?) and what
potential factors may explain the "living fossil"-condition.

My entire PhD thesis is available [here]({{< relref "/publication/bennett-2017-appraisal" >}})
and the slides and recording of a [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/)
presentation I gave -- that gives a brief overview of much of my thesis -- can be
downloaded [here]({{< relref "/publication/bennett-2019-roysoc" >}}).

## Which taxa are "living fossils"?

<sup>Below are the top "living fossil" birds and mammals according to their
proximate "Evolutionary Performance Index" (pEPI) -- the lower the less
performant and the more likely the taxon is a living fossil. The table also
holds key stats on over 20,000 other plants and animals. For more information
see the paper,
["Quantifying the Living Fossil Concept"](https://doi.org/10.26879/750)</sup>

<sub> *N.spp* = Number of species, *Age* = Time since clade split,
*Success* = number of species relative to sister,
*Change* = observed morpholoical and ecological change relative to sister,
*pEPI* = proximate evolutionary performance (excludes change) [plus % quartile], *EPI* = evolutionary performance (includes change),
