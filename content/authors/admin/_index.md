I develop software and play with data. I have a history in academia working in
bioinformatics, I have several
first-authorship and co-authorship publications across multiple fields in the
life sciences. I now work as a professional software developer and I'm currently
working within
[Ericsson's 5G Cloud Packet Core](https://www.ericsson.com/en/portfolio/digital-services/cloud-core/cloud-packet-core), Gothenburg, Sweden.

<small>

Prior to this position, I was a post-doc in the [Antonelli Lab](http://antonelli-lab.net/) at the
[University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/english), working on
pipelines in [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) for [phylogenetic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree). As
part of this work I converted the program
[SUPERSMART](http://supersmart-project.org/) into a series of smaller packages in R -- a project called 
["supersmartR"](#supersmartr).

I did my PhD at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and the
[Zoological Society of London](https://www.zsl.org/science) where I re-appraised
the ["living fossil"](#livingfossils) concept.

I particularly enjoy developing software and have created a range of open-source R and
[python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
packages for munging and analysing biological data (from DNA to species
records).
