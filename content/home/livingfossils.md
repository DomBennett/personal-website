As part of my PhD I explored questions around what a "living fossil" is;
whether the term is useful or not; what generates "living-fossil-ness"; and
whether these taxa are worth conserving.

Answering many of these questions resulted in many of my first-author
publications and a presentation at the [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/).

My entire PhD thesis is available [here]({{< ref "/publication/bennett-2017-appraisal" >}})
and the slides and recording of my Royal Society presentation -- that gives a
brief overview of many of thesis -- can be downloaded 
[here]({{< ref "/publication/bennett-2019-past2" >}}).
