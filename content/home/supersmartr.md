As part of my post-doc I'm devising and developing an automated pipeline for generating phylogenetic trees, `supersmartR`. This new program acts as an update on [SUPERSMART](http://www.supersmart-project.org/) and is comprised of a series of independent R packages.

All R packages developed as part of this project are aimed to be of the highest quality, and as a result they are all submitted to [ROpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) for thorough scrutiny, review and testing.

*For the latest updates on `supersmartR` progress, check out the [website](https://github.com/AntonelliLab/supersmartR).*
